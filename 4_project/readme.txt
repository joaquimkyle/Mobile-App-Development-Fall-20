    App Proposal readme.txt

    This is a work management app based on two productivity techniques: to-do lists and the pomodoro technique. It is designed to provide both structure and flexibility. Users can add tasks by priority, each task containing its own to-do list. Priority can also be decided by due date. Each task can also store shortcuts to other apps or webpages. Tasks of the same priority are presented together in a task group and the user can choose what to work on at the start of each pomodoro interval. Users are encouraged to complete one task group before advancing to the next, and can choose the order in which task groups are presented.
    
    Users can also add routines which they hope to complete every day. These can be configured as start-of-day routines or end-of-day routines, which are presented before or after work on task groups, respectively. A "Manage Tasks" routine can be used to quickly update task priorities. Users can also create habits. These habits are presented together - just like tasks are presented in task groups - in habit routines, which can be configured like any routine to appear at start-of-day, end-of-day, or following the completion of a task group. The habit routine provides users a choice and encourages them complete at least one habit, though they may complete more. 
    
    Users should be able to configure:
        -pomodoro interval length
        -pomodoro short break length
        -pomodoro long break length
        -number of intervals between long breaks
        -on completing a task: go to next break or run out current interval with new task 
        -auto prioritization by due date 
        -task group presentation: low->high or high->low 
        -target intervals/day 
        -target habits/day
